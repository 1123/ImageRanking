        <h3>Implicit Feedback Ranking by Acyclic Graph Maintenance</h3>
        <div>This page shows how the attractiveness of images can be learned from
            implicit feedback from users to a website.
            <ol>
                <li>Enter a search term below to search for tagged images on FlickR.</li>
                <li>A random sample of the retrieved images is displayed.</li>
                <li>Select an image that you like by clicking on it. A json call will be issued
                    to the server, including the list of ids of displayed images plus the selected image.
                    This is the implicit feedback shopping sites or social networks generate by users navigating the site.
                </li>
                <li>Navigate back to this page, which will display a different set of
                    pictures for the search term.</li>
                <li>Again, select an image that you like.</li>
                <li>Repeat the above steps a couple of times.</li>

                        This creates a user specific ranking for a set of items. We do not do
                        personalized ranking, since we are interested in the objective

                        This paper defines the dynamic priority-ordering problem.
                        <blockquote>
                            The vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) are said to be correctly prioritized
                            if every vertex v in the graph is assigned a priority, denoted by
                            priority(v), such that if there is an edge in the DAG from vertex
                            v to vertex w then priority(v) &lt; priority (w). The dynamic priority-ordering
                            problem is to maintain a correct prioritization of the graph as the DAG is modified.
